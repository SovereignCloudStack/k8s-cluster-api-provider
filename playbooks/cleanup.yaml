    # Some Kubernetes resources managed by the k8s-cluster-api-provider project employ names
    # formed by combining elements such as a prefix, cluster-name, and additional suffix.
    # This combined naming convention may potentially exceed the character limits imposed by
    # Kubernetes. To mitigate this issue, we take precautions by truncating both the prefix
    # and the cluster name to 12 characters each. This adjustment ensures that we stay
    # within Kubernetes' limits and allows us to utilize a single OpenStack project with
    # multiple k8s-capi deployments.
